# 🕰️ Uncovering the Main Drivers of Luxury Watch Prices
Welcome to this data-driven deep dive into the luxury watch market ⌚💎 — where heritage, craftsmanship, and precision meet data analytics. Whether you're a fellow watch enthusiast, a budding data analyst, or just curious about what makes a watch worth $1,000 vs. $100,000, this project is for you.

# 📚 Background & Inspiration
If you know me, I love watches. I bought my first luxury watch 15 months ago, and since then have developed a true love for horology. In this time, I have learned about what I like in a watch, what I am looking for in my next purchase, and have helped others buy their furst luxury timepiece. Given that collecting has been one of my favorite hobbies, I dove deeper into the world of horology and one question kept nagging me:

Why can two similar-looking watches vary so drastically in price?

This project helped me combine my passion for watches with my analytical skills to finally explore what drives these price differences — using real-world data.

# 📊 Project Overview
This project leverages a luxury watch dataset from Kaggle to identify key factors that influence watch prices. Through SQL queries and data visualizations, I explored:

✅ Average price by brand, country of origin, movement, and crystal material

✅ How case diameter affects pricing

✅ The impact of complications (chronograph, moonphase, tourbillon, etc.)

✅ Model counts vs. average prices across brands

✅ Trends in Swiss vs. non-Swiss timepieces

# 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools Used
SQL (PostgreSQL): Data querying and transformation

pgAdmin4:	SQL interface and database management

Tableau:	Dashboard and data visualizations



SQL Techniques Used:

* Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

* CASE statements

* GROUP BY, aggregation functions

* Data filtering and cleaning

# 📈 Visual Dashboard Snapshots
Here are a few examples of the interactive Tableau dashboards used:

📍 Average Price by Country of Origin

📍 Price vs. Case Diameter

📍 Complications and Their Price Impact

📍 Brand vs. Model Count Distribution

# 🧹 Data Challenges & Cleaning
* Many NaN and null values required filtering before analysis

* Prices contained commas (e.g., "15,000") which needed cleaning to ensure numerical accuracy

* Some records lacked clarity on complication types, requiring categorical simplification

# 💡 Key Insights & Recommendations
🧭 Swiss Brands Reign Supreme

* Swiss-made watches dominate the high-end spectrum, often linked to superior craftsmanship and heritage.

🔧 Movement Matters

* Automatic watches (especially Swiss) command higher prices than quartz.

🔍 Crystal Clarity Comes at a Cost

* Watches with sapphire crystal tend to be priced higher than those with mineral or acrylic crystals.

🌕 More Complications = Higher Price

* Watches with multiple complications (tourbillon, perpetual calendar, etc.) see significant price jumps.

💸 Best Value Tip

* Looking for affordability in the luxury space? GMT watches offer complexity without breaking the bank.
